      "In 1528, King François I decided to demolish the Louvre’s medieval keep. Goodbye to the original austere fortress! Since the start of his reign thirteen years earlier, the king had been keen to introduce the spirit of the Italian Renaissance to France. He had already invited Leonardo da Vinci to his court, and other Italian artists, such as Rosso Fiorentino and Francesco Primaticcio, would later work on his châteaux under construction outside Paris and on the banks of the Loire.",
      "François I chose the Louvre as his main residence in Paris, but construction work was necessary if the old fortress was to acquire the splendour and luxury of the Italian palaces the king had visited and admired. In 1546, he appointed the architect Pierre Lescot to oversee this monumental project. However, François died the following year and it was left to his son, King Henri II, to see the work through.",
      "The huge reception room known as the Salle des Cariatides was therefore completed during the reign of Henri II. The name of the room derives from the four ‘caryatids’ – sculpted female figures serving as columns – that support the musicians’ gallery. These were made by the sculptor Jean Goujon in 1550. True to the spirit of the Renaissance, his work was inspired by a classical model – in this case, the Forum of Augustus, built by the emperor in Rome in the 2nd century BC.",
      "The musicians’ gallery is a reminder of the days when the Salle des Cariatides was used as a ballroom. However, the room also served many other purposes and was the scene of important historical events, such as the funeral ceremony held after the assassination of Henri IV in 1610. And it was here that Molière first performed in front of Louis XIV, in the play Le Dépit amoureux and later in L’Étourdi and Les Précieuses ridicules.",
      "Sculptures from Louis XIV’s collection began to be exhibited here in 1692 and the room became known as the ‘Salle des Antiques’. In 1806, Napoleon I had it connected to the nearby rooms that had been converted into a gallery of antiquities by the architects Charles Percier and Pierre Fontaine (see Venus de Milo room and Anne of Austria’s Apartments). The latter also oversaw the completion of the decoration of the Salle des Cariatides: the arches of the vaulted ceiling were carved and the fireplace was reconstructed around two allegorical sculptures by Jean Goujon.",
      "Today, the Salle des Cariatides houses masterpieces from the collection of Greek sculptures – particularly statues of gods, goddesses and mythological heroes.",
      "Some of the works presented here are actually Roman marble copies of Greek bronze originals, as very few large Greek bronzes have survived.",
      "This is the case with the graceful Artemis with a Doe, in the middle of the room. This marble sculpture from the 2nd century BC was based on a bronze original made in about 330 BC. It is also known as the Diana of Versailles, as it used to adorn the Hall of Mirrors at the Château de Versailles.",

      "Among the cultural events designed to accompany the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Paris is an exhibition at the Louvre on the creation of the first modern Olympic Games. Visitors will discover how the Games came into being in the late 19th century: the political context of the time, the iconographic sources on which they were based, and how the organisers set out to recreate the sporting competitions of ancient Greece.",
      "The exhibition sheds light on the origins of the world’s largest and most-watched sporting competition. This international event was the brainchild of Pierre de Coubertin and a number of French and Greek luminaries, who were later joined by Swiss draughtsman Émile Gilliéron (1850-1924). Gilliéron trained at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, and was a frequent visitor to the Louvre, where he copied a number of its masterpieces. Having settled in Greece, he was named the official artist of the 1896 Olympic Games and of the 1906 Mesolympics, both held in Athens, for which he designed the winners’ trophies, inspired by discoveries made at the major archaeological excavation sites of the period. Using the latest reproduction techniques of his time, the artist illustrated communication materials – in particular postage stamps and posters – for the newly formed Greek state.",
      "Thanks to a special loan from the Stavros Niarchos Foundation (SNF), the Louvre will exhibit the first Olympic Cup, known as ‘Bréal’s Cup’, designed by French academic Michel Bréal and created by a French silversmith for the winner of the first marathon – a race invented for the modern Olympic Games.",
      "As part of the programme of cultural events accompanying the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games, the exhibition will show how the scientific disciplines of philology, history, art history and archaeology came together to create this global sporting event.",

      "The largest ever private collection of ancient Roman sculptures, assembled throughout the 19thcentury by the Torlonia princes in Rome, is being shown to the public for the first time since the mid-20th century in a series of special exhibitions.",
      "The Louvre will have the privilege of hosting the Torlonia marbles for their first showing outside Italy, in the renovated summer apartments of Anne of Austria – home to the museum’s permanent collection of ancient sculpture since its creation in the late 18th century.",
      "Displaying the Torlonia marbles alongside the French national collection will shed new light on the origin of museums and the interest in antiquity – a founding element of Western culture.",
      "Showcasing masterpieces of ancient sculpture, the exhibition will present some truly exquisite treasures of Roman art and explore the origins of museums in Europe during the Enlightenment and the 19th century.",
